## 1. URL-based multi-stage recall method (in 3.1.1)
A **URL-based multi-stage recall method** typically refers to an approach used in information retrieval or search systems where a series of steps or stages are applied to narrow down or "recall" the most relevant URLs or web pages based on a given query. This type of method is common in search engines, recommendation systems, or when developing a specialized crawler or data retrieval process.

### Key Components of a URL-based Multi-Stage Recall Method:
1. **Initial Query Understanding & Preprocessing:**
   - **Input Query**: The user provides a query in the form of a URL, keywords, or a natural language query.
   - **Query Parsing**: The query is analyzed to extract key terms or concepts.
   - **URL Matching**: This could involve exact matches, domain filtering, or other heuristic techniques to quickly identify potentially relevant URLs.

2. **Stage 1: Broad Candidate Selection (First Recall Stage)**
   - The system retrieves a large number of candidate URLs that are likely relevant to the query, typically using:
     - **Keyword Matching**: The query terms are used to search a large index or database of URLs.
     - **Search Engine Results**: Query terms are mapped to search engine indexes or third-party datasets.
     - **Predefined URL Pool**: In some systems, a fixed set of URLs (e.g., from a known set of trusted sources) is used as a starting point.

3. **Stage 2: Refinement & Filtering (Second Recall Stage)**
   - This stage narrows down the pool of candidate URLs by applying more specific filters:
     - **Content Relevance**: The system checks the actual content of the URLs for relevance to the query (e.g., using TF-IDF, BERT embeddings, etc.).
     - **Contextual Analysis**: Refinement based on the context in which the query was made (e.g., location, user history, or session data).
     - **Semantic Matching**: Advanced models like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformers (e.g., BERT) are used to understand the semantic relationship between the query and the content of the URLs.

4. **Stage 3: Ranking and Scoring (Third Recall Stage)**
   - The remaining candidate URLs are ranked based on relevance using scoring algorithms. This stage typically involves:
     - **Page Ranking Algorithms**: Techniques like PageRank or machine learning models that consider factors like backlinks, user engagement metrics, and domain authority.
     - **Content Quality**: Evaluating the quality of the content on each URL (e.g., reading level, clarity, depth, etc.).
     - **User Intent**: Sophisticated algorithms that attempt to understand the user's intent and personalize results (e.g., using user history, collaborative filtering, or deep learning models).

5. **Stage 4: Post-Processing (Optional)**
   - After ranking, the final list of URLs may go through additional steps like:
     - **Diversity Check**: Ensuring the result set is diverse (e.g., from different domains or presenting different perspectives).
     - **Bias Removal**: Adjusting the results to avoid any biases, like overrepresentation of certain domains.
     - **Filtering for Spam or Low-Quality Sites**: Using heuristic rules or machine learning to remove irrelevant or low-quality pages from the final result set.

### Applications of URL-based Multi-Stage Recall:
1. **Web Search Engines**: Most modern search engines use a multi-stage process where a broad set of URLs are first retrieved, filtered, and ranked before presenting a result set to the user.
2. **Content Recommendation Systems**: In platforms like YouTube or Netflix, URLs (or videos, articles, etc.) are recalled in multiple stages to ensure high-quality recommendations.
3. **Enterprise Search Solutions**: Within organizations, URL-based recall methods can be used to retrieve relevant internal documentation, articles, or knowledge base entries.
4. **Web Crawlers**: Multi-stage recall can be applied in web crawling to prioritize and retrieve relevant URLs from a vast corpus of the internet.

### Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the computational cost by narrowing down the search space gradually.
- **Accuracy**: By employing multiple stages of refinement, the final set of URLs is more likely to be highly relevant to the user's query.
- **Scalability**: The method can be adapted to handle large-scale data retrieval across millions of web pages or documents.

### Example:
Consider a query "best Italian restaurants in San Francisco". 

1. **Stage 1**: A search engine might first retrieve a large list of URLs containing the keywords "Italian restaurants" and "San Francisco".
2. **Stage 2**: It then filters these URLs by examining their content for specific mentions of "best" or customer reviews.
3. **Stage 3**: The URLs are ranked based on reviews, ratings, and geographic proximity to San Francisco.
4. **Stage 4**: The final URLs presented to the user are diverse in terms of restaurant type and user ratings, and they may also consider personalized data, such as previous searches or user preferences.

### Challenges:
- **Query Ambiguity**: If the query is too vague or broad (e.g., "best food"), filtering and ranking become more difficult.
- **Quality of Data**: Ensuring that the retrieved URLs are not only relevant but also high-quality and free from spam is crucial.
- **Scalability**: As the web grows, ensuring that the multi-stage recall method can scale while still providing high-quality results is a major challenge.

Overall, a URL-based multi-stage recall method is an essential technique for efficiently retrieving and ranking web content in response to user queries, with each stage refining the search to improve accuracy and relevance.

## 2. Rejection Sampling (in 4.2)
**Rejection Sampling** is a statistical technique used to generate random samples from a target probability distribution when direct sampling is difficult. Instead of directly sampling from the target distribution, the method involves sampling from an easier-to-sample proposal distribution and then rejecting or accepting those samples based on a criterion derived from the target distribution.

This technique is often used in situations where the target distribution is complex or unknown, but we have a simpler distribution from which we can sample and use to approximate the target.

### Steps in Rejection Sampling

1. **Define the Target and Proposal Distributions**:
   - Let the target distribution be \( p(x) \), which is the distribution we want to sample from.
   - Let the proposal distribution be \( q(x) \), from which we can easily sample. Typically, this distribution is chosen such that \( q(x) \) covers the support of \( p(x) \) (i.e., it is non-zero wherever \( p(x) \) is non-zero).

2. **Find an Envelope Function**:
   - Identify a constant \( M \) such that \( p(x) \leq M \cdot q(x) \) for all \( x \). This ensures that \( M q(x) \) acts as an upper bound (envelope) to the target distribution \( p(x) \).

3. **Sampling Procedure**:
   - **Step 1**: Sample a candidate point \( x' \) from the proposal distribution \( q(x) \).
   - **Step 2**: Generate a uniform random variable \( u \) from the interval \( [0, 1] \).
   - **Step 3**: Accept the candidate \( x' \) with probability \( \frac{p(x')}{M q(x')} \). This is done by comparing \( u \) with \( \frac{p(x')}{M q(x')} \):
     - If \( u \leq \frac{p(x')}{M q(x')} \), accept \( x' \) as a sample from \( p(x) \).
     - Otherwise, reject \( x' \) and return to **Step 1**.

4. **Repeat** the process until you have a sufficiently large number of accepted samples.

### Mathematical Explanation

Given a sample \( x' \) from the proposal distribution \( q(x) \), the probability of accepting \( x' \) is:

\[
P(\text{accept } x') = \frac{p(x')}{M q(x')}
\]

This acceptance probability is designed so that, in the long run, the accepted samples come from the target distribution \( p(x) \).

### Example

Letâ€™s consider an example to clarify the process:

- **Target Distribution** \( p(x) \): Suppose we want to sample from the normal distribution \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \).
- **Proposal Distribution** \( q(x) \): We might choose a uniform distribution \( U(-3, 3) \), since it's easy to sample from.

Now, the idea is to find a constant \( M \) such that:

\[
\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \leq M \cdot U(-3, 3)
\]

By visual inspection or calculation, we would find an appropriate value for \( M \). Then, we proceed with the rejection sampling procedure, sampling from \( U(-3, 3) \), and accepting/rejecting based on the ratio of the normal to the uniform distribution.

### When to Use Rejection Sampling

Rejection sampling is useful in the following cases:

1. **Sampling from complex distributions**: When the target distribution \( p(x) \) is difficult to sample from directly but can be approximated using a simpler proposal distribution \( q(x) \).
2. **When the target distribution has unknown form**: If you have a target distribution but no easy way to sample from it directly (e.g., in Bayesian inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods often use rejection sampling).
3. **When the target distribution is not normalized**: Rejection sampling can be used to generate samples from a distribution that is proportional to \( p(x) \), even if you do not know its normalization constant.

### Advantages of Rejection Sampling

- **Simplicity**: The method is conceptually simple and easy to implement.
- **Versatility**: Can be used in many situations, especially when direct sampling from the target distribution is difficult.
- **High-quality samples**: Rejection sampling can generate high-quality samples from complex distributions.

### Disadvantages of Rejection Sampling

- **Efficiency**: The method can be inefficient, especially if the proposal distribution \( q(x) \) is not well matched to the target distribution. If \( M \) is large, the acceptance rate can be very low, leading to wasted computations.
- **Need for an Envelope Function**: You must be able to find a suitable proposal distribution \( q(x) \) and constant \( M \) that provides a good upper bound for the target distribution.
- **Potentially Slow**: If the proposal distribution is not a good fit for the target, rejection sampling can require a large number of rejections before finding an accepted sample, making the process slow.

### Alternatives to Rejection Sampling

- **Importance Sampling**: Instead of rejecting samples, we weight each sample by the ratio \( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), which avoids wasting samples but still gives an approximation of the target distribution.
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Methods like Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling use random walks to generate samples from the target distribution, often more efficiently than rejection sampling.
- **Inverse Transform Sampling**: If the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the target distribution is invertible, you can directly sample from it by inverting the CDF.

### Example of Rejection Sampling in Python

Hereâ€™s a simple Python implementation using rejection sampling to sample from a normal distribution:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Target distribution: Normal distribution (mean=0, std=1)
def target_distribution(x):
    return np.exp(-x**2 / 2) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)

# Proposal distribution: Uniform distribution U(-3, 3)
def proposal_distribution():
    return np.random.uniform(-3, 3)

# Rejection sampling function
def rejection_sampling(n_samples):
    samples = []
    M = 1.0  # Envelope constant (adjust this depending on the target)
    while len(samples) < n_samples:
        x_prime = proposal_distribution()  # Sample from the proposal distribution
        u = np.random.uniform(0, 1)        # Uniform random number
        # Accept or reject based on the ratio of target to proposal
        if u <= target_distribution(x_prime) / (M * 1/6):  # M * proposal PDF value
            samples.append(x_prime)
    return np.array(samples)

# Generate samples using rejection sampling
samples = rejection_sampling(10000)

# Plot the histogram of the samples
x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)
plt.hist(samples, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.6, color='g', label='Samples')
plt.plot(x, target_distribution(x), label='Target distribution (Normal)', color='r')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this example:
- The **target distribution** is the standard normal distribution \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \).
- The **proposal distribution** is a uniform distribution \( U(-3, 3) \).
- The constant \( M \) is chosen such that the proposal distribution is scaled appropriately.

This code generates samples from the normal distribution using rejection sampling and compares them with the target distribution.

### Conclusion

Rejection sampling is a powerful and straightforward method for generating random samples from a complex distribution when direct sampling is not feasible. However, its efficiency depends heavily on the choice of the proposal distribution and the envelope constant. In practice, alternatives like MCMC may be more efficient for high-dimensional or complex target distributions.

### Easily said: when the target distribution is hard to express or compute in an easy form, use it.

## 3. LLM-as-a-judge
Certainly, here's a concise overview of the implementation method described in the article, in English:

The article "Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena" introduces a novel approach for evaluating the performance of chat assistants based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The core of this method, termed "LLM-as-a-judge," leverages powerful LLMs to assess the responses of chatbots, aiming to approximate human preferences in a scalable and explainable manner. Here's how it's implemented:

### LLM-as-a-Judge Types
- **Pairwise Comparison**: LLMs are presented with a question and two answers, tasked with determining which is better or declaring a tie.
- **Single Answer Grading**: LLMs directly assign scores to individual answers.
- **Reference-Guided Grading**: In some cases, reference solutions are provided to assist LLMs in grading.

### Advantages
- **Scalability**: Reduces human involvement, enabling benchmarking at scale and rapid iteration.
- **Explainability**: LLM judges offer scores and explanations, making their assessments interpretable.

### Limitations and Solutions
- **Position Bias**: LLMs may favor certain positions over others. This is addressed by swapping answer positions and only declaring a win when consistent.
- **Verbosity Bias**: LLMs might prefer longer answers. This bias is studied through "repetitive list" attacks to examine if LLMs favor verbosity over clarity.
- **Self-Enhancement Bias**: LLMs might favor their own answers. This is statistically examined but not conclusively proven.
- **Limited Reasoning Ability**: LLMs struggle with grading math and reasoning questions. Solutions include "chain-of-thought" and "reference-guided" methods to improve accuracy.

### Multi-Turn Judge
- The MT-bench benchmark involves two rounds of questions to evaluate conversational abilities. This requires presenting two full conversations to help LLM judges grasp context better.

### Agreement Evaluation
- **MT-bench**: Involves 6 models answering 80 questions, evaluated by LLM judges and 50 expert human labelers.
- **Chatbot Arena**: Uses 3K votes from 30K arena data, comparing LLM judges with crowd judges.

### Experimental Results
- **High Agreement**: GPT-4 shows over 80% agreement with human evaluators, matching human-human agreement levels.
- **Win Rates**: Win rate curves from LLM judges closely align with those from human judges.

### Data Collection and Release
- **MT-bench**: Interfaces show questions and answers from two assistants, asking humans to choose the better response.
- **Chatbot Arena**: Users interact with two anonymous models, voting on preferred responses.
- **Data Release**: Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is cleaned, and toxic conversations are tagged for dataset release.

This method represents a significant step towards automating the evaluation of chatbot performance using LLMs as judges, offering a scalable alternative to traditional human evaluations while maintaining a high level of agreement with human preferences.
